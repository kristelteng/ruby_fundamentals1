RUBY FUNDAMENTALS 1
===================

###Exercise 1:

Try Out a Ruby File in a text editor like Sublime. Write the code


###Exercise 2:

1. How would you calculate a good tip for a 55 dollar meal? Use puts to print the answer onscreen.

2. Try adding a string and an integer. What happens? Find a way to convert the integer so that it works and use puts to print the answer onscreen.

3. Evidently, Ruby is much more than just a calculator, but try outputting the result of 45628 multiplied by 7839 in a sentence by using string interpolation.

4. What's the value of the expression `(true && false) || (false && true) || !(false && false)`? Try figuring it out on your own before typing it in.


###Exercise 3:

Let's make a tiny Ruby program that greets someone by name.


###Exercise 4:

Write a program in a file called exercise4.rb that outputs the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, output "Bit" instead of the number and for multiples of five, output "Maker". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, output "BitMaker".
